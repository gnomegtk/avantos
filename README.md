# Avantos Journey Builder

This project is a minimal React application for the Journey Builder coding challenge. It demonstrates a system that retrieves a blueprint graph from a mock server, transforms the data into an array of forms, and allows the user to configure prefill mappings for each form's fields.

## Features

- **Form List**: Renders a list of forms fetched from a mock server.
- **Prefill Mapping**: Opens a modal for each form field, allowing the user to choose mapping data.
- **Mapping Modal**: Provides both global and dependent form field options for prefill configuration.


## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher recommended)
- Preferably a lightweight environment (this project is built using Vite for fast setup)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gnomegtk/avantos.git
   cd avantos
